#All Stocks Analysis
-This project was designed to show how VBA can be used to compare large datasets and compare results with the use of loops and nested loops.

##Using Loops
---
*By using nested loops we can bundle many requirements and conditions to see variables and comparisons.  This was the preferred method here as this can show structure and is easily read by other professionals and can be used by end users quickly and without the requirement of installing the developer tools.

*Unfortunately this particular was not completed due to the time restraints and therefore as you review the challenge itself you will see that the code does not run.  
However if you view the file from the exercises you will see the first nested loop code does in fact work.

*It is my conclusion that using a nested loop configuration on a project like this would be faster and provide the results that an end user would want and would want to use.  
*In short refactoring code can lead to wasting time and lots of debugging while you try to enter various other styles or more smaller loops.
