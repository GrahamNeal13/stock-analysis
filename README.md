#All Stocks Analysis
-This project was designed to show how VBA can be used to compare large datasets and compare results with the use of loops and nested loops.

##Using Loops
---
*By using nested loops we can bundle many requirements and conditions to see variables and comparisons.  This was the preferred method here as this can show structure and is easily read by other professionals and can be used by end users quickly and without the requirement of installing the developer tools.

*Unfortunately this particular was not completed due to the time restraints and therefore as you review the challenge itself you will see that the code does not run.  After reviewing the code and performing extreme changes such as deleteing the entire project and starting over I was able to have the code run correctly in VBA.  
However if you view the file from the exercises you will see the first nested loop code does in fact work.  There are provided files of the broken code, the corrected code, and the other project sheet for review and comparison.

*It is my conclusion that using a nested loop configuration on a project like this would be faster and provide the results that an end user would want to use.  As for the refactoring of the code a looped code structures is easier to identify errors.  As I reviewed the broken code with a classmate we were unable to see where the listed error was within the code line highlighted by the debugger.  As indicated in the image below, it was not until I deleted the entire code chain and redid it line by line I was able to fix the code and have it perform the required functions.
